# Bootstrap and Configuration Implementation

This document describes the implementation of the bootstrap and configuration features for the P2P-Java project, addressing the issues identified in the analysis.

## Issues Addressed

1. **Manual startup sequence required**
   - Implemented a BootstrapService class that handles automatic startup of components in the correct order
   - Created a P2PBootstrap main class as a unified entry point for the system

2. **No proper configuration management**
   - Implemented a ConfigurationManager class that centralizes all configuration
   - Added support for loading configuration from properties files, environment variables, and command-line arguments
   - Implemented configuration validation to ensure required settings are present

3. **No service health checks**
   - Created a HealthCheckServer class that provides HTTP endpoints for monitoring component health
   - Moved the HealthCheck utility class to the common module for use across all components
   - Implemented detailed health status reporting with JSON responses

4. **Hard-coded ports and addresses**
   - Made all ports and addresses configurable through the configuration system
   - Added support for dynamic port allocation to automatically find available ports

## Implementation Details

### Configuration Management

The `ConfigurationManager` class provides a centralized way to manage configuration for the P2P system. It supports loading configuration from multiple sources:

1. Default values hardcoded in the application
2. Properties files in various locations
3. Environment variables with the prefix `P2P_`
4. Command-line arguments with the format `--key=value`

Configuration values are loaded in order of precedence, with command-line arguments having the highest priority.

The class provides type-safe getters for different data types (string, integer, long, boolean) and includes validation to ensure required configuration is present.

### Bootstrap Service

The `BootstrapService` class is responsible for starting the P2P system components in the correct order based on their dependencies. It uses reflection to dynamically create service instances and call their start and stop methods.

Key features:
- Service registration with start and stop method names
- Dependency management between services
- Automatic startup in dependency order
- Graceful shutdown in reverse order
- Health check integration
- Timeout handling for service startup

### Health Check Server

The `HealthCheckServer` class provides HTTP endpoints for monitoring the health of system components. It uses the built-in `com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer` to expose the following endpoints:

- `GET /health`: Returns the overall health status of the system
- `GET /health/details`: Returns detailed health status information for all components
- `GET /health/service?name=<service>`: Returns health status information for a specific service

Health status is returned in JSON format and includes information such as whether the service is up or down, when it was last checked, and any additional details provided by the service.

### Dynamic Port Allocation

The `ConfigurationManager` class includes a `findAvailablePort` method that can be used to find an available port starting from a specified port number. This is useful for dynamically allocating ports when the configured port is already in use.

When the `bootstrap.dynamic.ports` configuration is set to `true`, the bootstrap system will automatically find available ports for services.

### Main Application

The `P2PBootstrap` class serves as the main entry point for the P2P system. It parses command-line arguments, initializes the configuration, creates and configures the BootstrapService, and starts the system.

It supports different startup modes:
- `start`: Start the specified components
- `stop`: Stop the specified components
- `status`: Show the status of the specified components

It also allows specifying which components to start:
- `tracker`: Start only the tracker
- `indexserver`: Start only the index server
- `peer`: Start only the peer
- `all`: Start all components (default)

## Usage

See the [Bootstrap Guide](bootstrap_guide.md) for detailed instructions on how to use the bootstrap system.

## Future Improvements

1. **External Service Registry Integration**
   - Add support for external service registries like ZooKeeper, Consul, or etcd
   - Implement leader election for high availability

2. **Enhanced Monitoring**
   - Add more detailed metrics for service performance
   - Implement alerting for service failures

3. **Configuration Hot Reloading**
   - Add support for reloading configuration without restarting services
   - Implement a configuration change notification system

4. **Containerization Support**
   - Add support for running in containers (Docker, Kubernetes)
   - Implement health probes for container orchestration

5. **Security Enhancements**
   - Add authentication for health check endpoints
   - Implement secure configuration storage
