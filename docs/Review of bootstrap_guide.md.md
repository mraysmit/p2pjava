# Review of bootstrap_guide.md

After reviewing the `bootstrap_guide.md` document and comparing it with the implementation in `BootstrapService.java` and `P2PBootstrap.java`, I've found that the documentation is generally accurate but has a few areas that could be updated to fully reflect the latest functionality.

## Accurate Aspects of the Documentation

1. **Configuration Management**: The document correctly describes the configuration sources, files, and format.
2. **Command-Line Arguments**: The options and examples for using P2PBootstrap are accurate.
3. **Health Check Endpoints**: The document correctly describes the health check endpoints and response format.
4. **Dynamic Port Allocation**: The explanation of dynamic port allocation is accurate.

## Areas Needing Updates

1. **Health Check Implementation**: The document doesn't explicitly mention that the `HealthCheckServer` is started by the `BootstrapService` when `healthcheck.enabled` is set to true.

2. **P2PBootstrap Health Registration**: The documentation doesn't mention that `P2PBootstrap` registers itself with the health check system, which allows its status to be monitored.

3. **Peer Component Handling**: The document doesn't clarify that peer components are handled separately from the tracker and index server components, as shown in the code:
   ```java
   if (components.contains(ALL) || components.contains(PEER)) {
       // For peers, we need to create instances with configuration
       // This will be handled separately
       logger.info("Peer startup will be handled separately");
   }
   ```

4. **Graceful Shutdown**: The documentation doesn't mention that `BootstrapService` sets up a shutdown hook for graceful shutdown:
   ```java
   Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread(this::stop));
   ```

5. **Usage Information**: The `printUsage()` method in `P2PBootstrap` is not mentioned in the documentation, though it provides helpful usage information.

6. **Health Check Endpoints**: The document doesn't mention the additional `/health/detailed` endpoint that exists for test compatibility.

## Recommendations

1. Add a section about how the bootstrap system handles graceful shutdown.
2. Clarify how peer components are handled differently from other components.
3. Update the health check section to mention that P2PBootstrap registers with the health check system.
4. Add information about the usage help that's available through the `printUsage()` method.
5. Update the health check endpoints section to include all available endpoints.

Overall, the `bootstrap_guide.md` document is a good reflection of the current implementation, but these updates would make it more comprehensive and accurate.
