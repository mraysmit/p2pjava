# Scalability Improvements for P2P-Java

This document outlines the scalability improvements implemented in the P2P-Java project to address the issues identified in the analysis.

## 1. Persistent Storage

### Problem
The original implementation used in-memory storage for file indexes and peer information, which had several limitations:
- Data was lost when the server was restarted
- Memory usage grew unbounded as more files and peers were added
- No support for data recovery in case of crashes

### Solution
Implemented a persistent storage mechanism for the IndexServer:

1. Created a `FileIndexStorage` interface that defines operations for storing and retrieving file index information
2. Implemented a file-based storage implementation (`FileBasedIndexStorage`) that stores data in a serialized format on disk
3. Modified the IndexServer to use this storage implementation instead of in-memory maps
4. Added proper initialization and shutdown procedures for the storage

### Benefits
- File index data persists across server restarts
- Reduced memory usage as data can be paged to disk
- Better recovery capabilities in case of crashes
- Ability to handle much larger file indexes without running out of memory

## 2. Connection Pooling

### Problem
The original implementation created new connections for each request, which had several drawbacks:
- High overhead for connection establishment
- Resource exhaustion under high load
- No limits on concurrent connections

### Solution
Implemented a connection pool to manage network connections:

1. Created a `ConnectionPool` class that manages a pool of connections
2. Added configuration for maximum connections and connection timeout
3. Implemented proper resource management with semaphores to limit concurrent connections
4. Added statistics tracking for monitoring connection usage

### Benefits
- Reduced connection establishment overhead
- Better resource utilization
- Protection against resource exhaustion
- Improved performance under high load
- Better monitoring capabilities

## 3. Caching

### Problem
The original implementation accessed the storage for every request, which was inefficient for frequently accessed data:
- High latency for repeated requests
- Unnecessary disk I/O
- No optimization for hot data

### Solution
Implemented a caching mechanism for frequently accessed data:

1. Created a generic `CacheManager` class that can cache any type of data
2. Added support for automatic expiration and refresh of cache entries
3. Integrated the cache with the IndexServer for file lookups
4. Implemented cache invalidation when data changes
5. Added statistics tracking for monitoring cache performance

### Benefits
- Reduced latency for frequently accessed data
- Decreased disk I/O
- Better scalability under high load
- Improved overall system performance
- Better monitoring capabilities

## 4. Common Data Model

### Problem
The original implementation had duplicate data models across modules, which caused compatibility issues and made it difficult to share data:
- Duplicate PeerInfo classes in different modules
- No common data model for sharing information
- Type conversion issues when passing data between modules

### Solution
Created a common data model that can be shared across modules:

1. Created a common `PeerInfo` class in the p2p-common module
2. Made the common class serializable for persistence
3. Added proper equals and hashCode methods for comparison
4. Updated all modules to use the common class

### Benefits
- Eliminated duplicate code
- Improved type safety
- Better interoperability between modules
- Support for serialization and persistence

## 5. Service Discovery

### Problem
The original implementation had hard-coded service addresses, which limited scalability and resilience:
- No support for multiple service instances
- No automatic discovery of services
- No failover capabilities

### Solution
Implemented a service registry framework for service discovery:

1. Created interfaces for service registration and discovery
2. Implemented an in-memory service registry as a reference implementation
3. Added support for service health checks
4. Integrated the service registry with the Tracker component

### Benefits
- Support for multiple service instances
- Automatic discovery of services
- Improved resilience through failover
- Better scalability through load balancing

## Conclusion

These improvements have significantly enhanced the scalability, reliability, and performance of the P2P-Java system. The system can now handle larger file indexes, more concurrent users, and provide better performance under load. The modular design of the improvements also makes it easier to extend and maintain the system in the future.

Future work could include:
- Implementing a distributed hash table (DHT) for even better scalability
- Adding support for external service registries like ZooKeeper or Consul
- Implementing database-backed storage for very large file indexes
- Adding support for sharding to distribute the load across multiple servers
