# Implemented Features for P2P-Java

This document outlines the features that have been implemented in the P2P-Java project to address the requirements specified in the issue description.

## 1. Peer and File Deregistration Mechanisms

### Implementation Details

#### IndexServer Changes
- Added `deregisterFile` method to remove a file from a peer in the index
- Added `deregisterPeer` method to remove all files associated with a peer
- Updated cache invalidation to ensure fresh data after deregistration

#### IndexServerHandler Changes
- Added support for `DEREGISTER_FILE` command to deregister a specific file
- Added support for `DEREGISTER_PEER` command to deregister all files for a peer

#### Tracker Changes
- Added `deregisterPeer` method to remove a peer from the tracker
- Added support for peer cleanup from both the last seen map and peers map

#### TrackerHandler Changes
- Added `removePeer` method to remove a peer from the peers map
- Added support for `DEREGISTER` command to deregister a peer

#### Peer Changes
- Added `deregisterFromTracker` method to deregister from the tracker on shutdown
- Added `deregisterFilesFromIndexServer` method to deregister files on shutdown
- Updated the `stop` method to call these deregistration methods
- Implemented proper error handling and metrics for deregistration operations

### Usage

When a peer is shutting down, it will automatically:
1. Deregister from the tracker to indicate it's no longer available
2. Deregister all its files from the index server

Clients can also manually deregister files or peers by sending the appropriate commands:
- `DEREGISTER_FILE <fileName> <peerId> <port>` to the index server
- `DEREGISTER_PEER <peerId> <port>` to the index server
- `DEREGISTER <peerId>` to the tracker

## 2. Advanced Search Capabilities

### Implementation Details

#### FileIndexStorage Changes
- Added `searchFiles` method to search for files matching a pattern
- Implemented pattern matching with support for wildcards and partial names

#### IndexServer Changes
- Added `searchFiles` method to expose the search functionality
- Added proper logging and error handling for search operations

#### IndexServerHandler Changes
- Added support for `SEARCH_FILES` command to search for files
- Implemented response formatting for search results

#### FileMetadata Changes
- Added `matchesQuery` method to check if a file matches a search query
- Implemented matching against file name, extension, MIME type, and other metadata

### Usage

Clients can search for files using the `SEARCH_FILES` command:
```
SEARCH_FILES <pattern>
```

The pattern can include wildcards (`*`) and will match against:
- File names (partial matches)
- File extensions
- MIME types
- Other metadata

The response will be a map of matching file names to lists of peers that have those files.

## 3. File Integrity Verification

### Implementation Details

#### ChecksumUtil Class
- Created a utility class for calculating and verifying checksums
- Implemented support for different algorithms (SHA-256 by default)
- Added methods for calculating checksums for files, paths, input streams, and byte arrays
- Added methods for verifying checksums

#### PeerHandler Changes
- Updated `handleGetFile` method to calculate a checksum for the file
- Modified the file transfer protocol to include the checksum in the response
- Added error handling for checksum calculation failures

#### P2PClient Changes
- Updated `downloadFileFromPeer` method to read the checksum from the response
- Added verification of the downloaded file's integrity using the checksum
- Implemented proper error handling and reporting for checksum verification

### Usage

When a client downloads a file, the integrity verification happens automatically:
1. The peer calculates a checksum for the file before sending it
2. The peer sends the checksum along with the file
3. The client verifies the downloaded file's integrity by comparing checksums
4. If the checksums don't match, the client reports an error

## 4. File Metadata Support

### Implementation Details

#### FileMetadata Class
- Created a class to represent metadata about files
- Included basic file information: name, size, checksum
- Added file timestamps: creation time, last modified time
- Implemented support for additional metadata: extension, MIME type, etc.
- Added methods for creating metadata from a file and matching search queries

### Usage

The FileMetadata class can be used to:
1. Store and retrieve metadata about files
2. Create metadata from a file path
3. Match files against search queries
4. Verify file integrity using checksums

## Features Not Yet Implemented

The following features were mentioned in the issue description but have not been implemented in this session:

### Authentication and Authorization
- User management functionality
- Token-based authentication
- Authorization checks for critical operations

### TLS/SSL for Secure Communications
- SSL context and keystore/truststore
- Secure server sockets
- Secure client connections
- SSL configuration parameters

## Conclusion

The implemented features significantly improve the P2P-Java system by adding:
- Proper cleanup of resources when peers disconnect
- Advanced search capabilities for finding files
- File integrity verification to ensure files are not corrupted
- Rich metadata support for better file management and searching

These features make the system more robust, reliable, and user-friendly.
