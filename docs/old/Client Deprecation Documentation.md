# Client Deprecation Documentation

## Overview

This document explains the deprecation of the `Client.java` file in the p2p-java project.

## Background

The `Client.java` file was part of the original implementation of the p2p-java project, before the major refactoring work. It provided a simple client implementation with basic functionality for listing and downloading files from a server.

## Reasons for Deprecation

The `Client.java` file has been deprecated for the following reasons:

1. **Outdated Architecture**: The `Client` class was designed for a simple client-server architecture, not the peer-to-peer architecture that the project now uses.

2. **Redundant Functionality**: The functionality provided by `Client.java` has been replaced by the more robust `P2PClient` class.

3. **Limited Features**: The `Client` class had very basic functionality compared to the `P2PClient` class, which includes:
   - Retry logic for downloads
   - Connection timeouts
   - Binary protocol with DataInputStream/DataOutputStream
   - File integrity verification with checksums
   - Progress reporting during downloads
   - Error handling and reporting

4. **No Usage**: Analysis of the codebase showed that the `Client` class was not being used by any other files in the project.

## Implementation Details

Rather than removing the `Client.java` file entirely, it has been deprecated with appropriate warnings and documentation:

1. **Class-level JavaDoc**: Added detailed documentation explaining why the class is deprecated and what to use instead.

2. **@Deprecated Annotation**: Applied the standard Java `@Deprecated` annotation to the class and all its methods.

3. **Warning Messages**: Updated method implementations to issue runtime warnings if anyone tries to use the deprecated class.

4. **References to Alternative**: Included references to `P2PClient` as the recommended alternative.

## Example

```java
/**
 * This file has been deprecated and is no longer used in the project.
 * 
 * The functionality provided by this class has been replaced by the more robust
 * P2PClient class, which is specifically designed for the P2P architecture with
 * advanced features like:
 * 
 * - Retry logic for downloads
 * - Connection timeouts
 * - Binary protocol with DataInputStream/DataOutputStream
 * - File integrity verification with checksums
 * - Progress reporting during downloads
 * - Error handling and reporting
 * 
 * Please use P2PClient instead for all client operations.
 * 
 * @see dev.mars.p2pjava.P2PClient
 * @deprecated This class is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
 */
@Deprecated
public class Client {
    // Deprecated methods with warning messages
}
```

## Future Plans

The `Client.java` file will be maintained in its deprecated state for a transition period to ensure backward compatibility. In a future release, it may be removed entirely once all potential dependencies have been updated to use `P2PClient` instead.

## Migration Guide

If you are currently using the `Client` class, you should migrate to the `P2PClient` class as follows:

1. Replace `Client` instantiation with `P2PClient`:
   ```java
   // Old code
   Client client = new Client();
   
   // New code
   P2PClient client = new P2PClient(trackerHost, trackerPort, indexServerHost, indexServerPort);
   ```

2. Replace `listFiles()` with appropriate `P2PClient` methods:
   ```java
   // Old code
   client.listFiles();
   
   // New code
   List<PeerInfo> peers = client.discoverPeersWithFile(fileName);
   ```

3. Replace `downloadFile()` with `P2PClient` download method:
   ```java
   // Old code
   client.downloadFile(fileName);
   
   // New code
   String result = client.downloadFileFromPeer(fileName, testFilesDir, peer);
   ```

## Conclusion

The deprecation of `Client.java` is part of the ongoing effort to improve the p2p-java project by moving toward a more robust, scalable, and feature-rich peer-to-peer architecture. The `P2PClient` class provides a superior alternative that is better aligned with the project's current direction.
