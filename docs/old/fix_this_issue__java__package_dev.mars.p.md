The issue is that the p2p-tracker module (which is a Java Platform Module System module) is trying to access classes from the p2p-discovery module, but it doesn't have the proper "requires" statement in its module-info.java file.

To fix this issue, you need to modify the module-info.java file in the p2p-tracker module to add a "requires" statement for the p2p-discovery module.

Here's the updated module-info.java file:

```java
module dev.mars.p2ptracker {
    // Export the package containing the Tracker and TrackerHandler classes
    exports dev.mars.p2pjava;

    // Require the java.logging module as specified in the issue description
    requires java.logging;

    // Require other Java modules used by the p2p-tracker module
    requires java.base; // This is implicit, but included for clarity

    requires java.net.http; // For HTTP client functionality

    // Require the p2p-discovery module
    requires dev.mars.p2pdiscovery;
}
```

The key change is adding the line `requires dev.mars.p2pdiscovery;` which tells the Java module system that the p2p-tracker module depends on the p2p-discovery module.

After making this change, the p2p-tracker module will be able to access classes from the p2p-discovery module, and the compilation error will be resolved.
